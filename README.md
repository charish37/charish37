## 🧠 About Me

Hi, I'm Charishma — a builder at heart, an athlete by spirit, and a lifelong learner.

My journey into tech was fueled by the same discipline and energy I brought to the track field. As an athlete, I learned the value of consistency, focus, and pushing limits — lessons I now channel into designing clean, purposeful, and impactful digital products.

Currently, I'm working on a **MERN stack supply chain project for Macy’s** at the **University of Cincinnati's IT Solution Center**, where I’m building scalable features, refining user flows, and contributing to real-world enterprise systems.

- 🌱 I'm always exploring new tools across frontend, backend, and DevOps — from React Native and Firebase to CI/CD pipelines
- 🧠 I enjoy working on projects that blend real-time systems, user empathy, and thoughtful architecture
- 🏗️ Projects like PlayGround App let me combine my passion for community with technical creativity
- 💬 I believe in clean code, continuous improvement, and collaboration that elevates everyone involved

Let’s build something cool together!
